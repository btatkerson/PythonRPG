PythonRPG
=========

The working-title Open-Source (GPL v3) RPG game engine based on the DnD 3.5e ruleset and
Bioware's Neverwinter Nights.

As of August 3, 2015, creature.py has basic racial and class features implemented. 

test_battle.py is the only current working demonstration of our engine in practice.

I assure you, there is plenty to come.
